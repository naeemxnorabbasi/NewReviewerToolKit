\section*{Introduction}
This document outlines a structured process for reviewing a research paper, writing a comprehensive review, and providing critical feedback to the authors. The goal is to clearly identify the paper's contribution, remove any writing clutter, identify and state strengths and weaknesses factually, and raise questions that can move the research forward.

\section{Initial Reading}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Skim the Paper}: Quickly go through the paper to get a general idea of its content, structure, and main contributions.
    \item \textbf{Read the Abstract}: Ensure it accurately summarizes the paper's objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Detailed Reading}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Introduction}: Understand the problem being addressed, the research questions, and the motivation for the study.
    \item \textbf{Literature Review}: Check the background information and related work. Ensure it’s comprehensive and up-to-date.
    \item \textbf{Methodology}: Evaluate the research design, procedures, and analysis methods used. Ensure they are appropriate and well-described.
    \item \textbf{Results}: Look at the data presented. Ensure the results are clear, well-organized, and properly interpreted.
    \item \textbf{Discussion}: Assess how well the results are discussed in the context of the research questions and existing literature.
    \item \textbf{Conclusion}: Ensure it summarizes the findings, implications, and future research directions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Critical Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Contribution}: Identify the paper's main contributions to the field. Ensure these are significant and clearly stated.
    \item \textbf{Strengths}: Highlight the strong points of the paper, such as novel insights, robust methodology, clear writing, etc.

\section{How to Write an Abstract (Koopman)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Purpose of the Abstract}: The abstract should provide a concise summary of the paper's content. It should highlight the key points and findings without unnecessary details.
    \item \textbf{Content of the Abstract}: A good abstract answers these questions:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{What is the problem?}
        \item \textbf{Why is it important?}
        \item \textbf{What methods were used to solve it?}
        \item \textbf{What were the main results?}
        \item \textbf{What do the results mean?}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Structure of the Abstract}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Motivation}: Why do we care about the problem and the results?
        \item \textbf{Problem Statement}: What problem are you trying to solve?
        \item \textbf{Approach}: How did you go about solving or making progress on the problem?
        \item \textbf{Results}: What is the answer?
        \item \textbf{Conclusions}: What are the implications of your answer?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Tips for Writing the Abstract}:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Be concise}: Make sure every word is necessary.
        \item \textbf{Be clear}: Use simple, direct language.
